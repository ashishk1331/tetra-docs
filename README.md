# Tetra Pack
A simple and configurable notion API parser for react projects.

## Features -
- Robust and granular Parser
- Keyed Approach
- Configurable blocks and annotations
- Loose Type Checking

# Tetra Pack

First things first,

-   It isn't bundled with `@notion/client`. Hence, you need to require it externally.
-   It renders pre-cooked API data into pure html tags.
-   It follows keyed approach.
    > Every element is rendered with a unique key to avoid UI mis-match or clashes.
-   All the blocks are configurable and can be replaced or extended.
