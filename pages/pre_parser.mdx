# Pre Parser

Pre Parser as the name suggests is a step we take before passing data to the `<Parser />` itself.
Main objective here is to collect children of blocks like `table` or `nested lists`, because the `<Parser />` Component renders the passed data only and if any complex blocks are found they are silently overlooked.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
If want to render `table` or `nested lists`, this step is mandatory.
</Callout>

## Implementation

+ It takes two parameters, that are `blocks` the original blocks fetched and `getBlocks` function itself. 
+ `usePreParser` is a async function and should be handled carefully to avoid unnecessary errors.

```jsx
import { Parser, usePreParser } from "tetrapack";

export default async function Home() {
    let blocks = await getBlocks(process.env.NOTION_PAGE_ID);
    blocks = await usePreParser(blocks, getBlocks);

    return (
    	<Parser blocks={blocks} />
    );
}
```
