# Strike Through

All the text formatted as `striked` will be rendered using `<s />` tag, anywhere in the document.

The element receives `text` and `key` as parameter and should return node type value.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Node Type Value is anything that can be rendered: numbers, strings, elements or an array.
</Callout>

## Pre-Defined Syntax

```jsx
	annotations: {
		strikethrough: (text, key) => (
			<s key={key}>
				{text}
			</s>
		),
	}
```
