# Mark

This is the most interesting bit of all the parsing. This property handles the *`foreground and background colors`* which are being applied to the text. Hence, such formatted text is wrapped inside a `<mark />` tag and suitable styles are applied on it via style object.

The element receives `text`, `style` object which conatins the foreground and background color styles and `key` as parameter and should return node type value.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Node Type Value is anything that can be rendered: numbers, strings, elements or an array.
</Callout>

## Pre-Defined Syntax

```jsx
	annotations: {
		mark: (text, style, key) => (
			<mark key={key} style={style}>
				{text}
			</mark>
		),
	}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Notion provides 10 color options including default color for text formatting. These are `blue`, `brown`, `gray`, `green`, `orange`, `pink`, `purple`, `red` and `yellow`.
</Callout>

## Change Fore-Ground Colors
All the colors for text are listed in `color` object inside `annotations` object. Every color can be over-written with a valid css color.

```jsx
	annotations: {
		...,
		color: {
				default: "",
				blue: "blue",
				brown: "brown",
				gray: "gray",
				green: "green",
				orange: "orange",
				pink: "pink",
				purple: "purple",
				red: "red",
				yellow: "yellow",
			},
	}
```

## Change Back-Ground Colors
All the colors for text background are listed in `background` object inside `annotations` object. Every color property can be over-written with a valid css color.

```jsx
	annotations: {
		...,
		background: {
				default: "",
				blue: "blue",
				brown: "brown",
				gray: "gray",
				green: "green",
				orange: "orange",
				pink: "pink",
				purple: "purple",
				red: "red",
				yellow: "yellow",
			},
	}
```
